# Dexter Industrial Dryer — Maintenance Guide

## Lint Trap Cleaning

The lint trap should be cleaned after every load of laundry. To clean the lint trap:

1. Open the dryer door
2. Pull the lint screen straight up and out of its housing
3. Roll the lint off the screen with your fingers
4. Replace the screen by pushing it firmly back into the housing until it clicks

**Important:** Never operate the dryer without the lint screen in place. A missing or damaged lint screen can cause lint to build up in the exhaust system, creating a fire hazard.

## Deep Cleaning the Lint Trap (Weekly)

Once a week, wash the lint screen with warm soapy water and a soft brush. This removes the invisible film left by dryer sheets that can reduce airflow. Allow the screen to dry completely before reinserting.

## Exhaust System Maintenance

The exhaust duct should be inspected and cleaned every 6 months, or more frequently in high-use commercial environments. Signs that the exhaust system needs cleaning include:

- Clothes taking longer than normal to dry
- The dryer exterior feels hotter than usual
- A burning smell during operation
- Excessive lint around the dryer area

## Temperature Calibration

If clothes are coming out too hot or not drying properly, the temperature sensor may need calibration. Contact Dexter service at 1-800-555-DRYER for calibration procedures. Do not attempt to adjust the temperature sensor yourself as this may void your warranty.
