# Dexter Industrial Dryer — Troubleshooting Guide

## Dryer Won't Start

If the dryer does not start when the start button is pressed:

1. **Check the door:** The door must be fully closed and latched. The door switch prevents operation when open.
2. **Check power supply:** Verify the circuit breaker hasn't tripped. Industrial dryers require a dedicated 30A circuit.
3. **Check coin mechanism (commercial models):** Ensure coins have been accepted and the cycle has been paid for.
4. **Check the motor:** If you hear a humming noise but the drum doesn't turn, the motor may be overloaded. Wait 30 minutes and try again.
5. **Check the thermal fuse:** If the thermal fuse has blown, the dryer will not start. This fuse is a one-time safety device and must be replaced by a qualified technician.

## Dryer Not Heating

If the dryer runs but doesn't produce heat:

1. **Gas models:** Check that the gas supply valve is fully open. Verify pilot light is lit (older models).
2. **Electric models:** Check both legs of the 240V circuit. The dryer may tumble on 120V but won't heat.
3. **All models:** Check the exhaust vent for blockage. A restricted exhaust can cause the high-limit thermostat to trip.
4. **Check the flame sensor (gas) or heating element (electric):** These components can fail with age.

## Excessive Noise

Unusual noises during operation may indicate:

- **Thumping:** Usually normal with heavy or bunched items. If persistent, check the drum support rollers.
- **Squealing:** The belt may be worn or slipping. Inspect the belt and idler pulley.
- **Scraping:** A foreign object may be caught between the drum and housing. Stop the dryer and check.
- **Rattling:** Check for loose panels, screws, or objects in the drum.

## Clothes Taking Too Long to Dry

The most common causes of extended drying times are:

1. **Blocked lint trap** — Clean after every load
2. **Restricted exhaust vent** — Check for kinks, blockages, or excessive length
3. **Overloading** — Don't fill beyond 75% drum capacity
4. **Room ventilation** — Ensure adequate air supply to the dryer
5. **Incorrect heat setting** — Commercial loads typically need medium-high heat

## Dryer Overheating

If the dryer exterior is excessively hot to touch:

1. **STOP THE DRYER IMMEDIATELY**
2. Check the exhaust vent for blockage — this is the #1 cause
3. Clean the lint trap thoroughly
4. Ensure minimum 4 inches clearance on all sides of the dryer
5. If problem persists after clearing vents, contact service at 1-800-555-DRYER

## Staining or Marking Clothes

If clothes are coming out with marks or stains:

- **Grease spots:** The drum seal or bearing may be leaking lubricant. Schedule service.
- **Rust spots:** Check the drum interior for chipped or damaged areas. Use touch-up paint designed for dryers.
- **Blue/black marks:** Items may be catching on worn drum glides. Replace the glides.
